### [Elm](http:://elm-lang.org)
* Typed functional language

#### Imperative vs. Declarative
* **Imperative**: define what you want and how you want it
* **Declarative**: ask for what you want and let the class/method determine how

#### Immutability
* same parameters => same results
* data is never modified
